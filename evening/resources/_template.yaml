# The endpoint URL.
# If omitted the resource key of the DOMAIN dict will be used to build the URL.
# As an example, contacts would make the people resource available at /contacts (instead of /people).
# URL can be as complex as needed and can be nested relative to another API endpoint (you can have a /contacts endpoint and then a /contacts/overseas endpoint.
# Both are independent of each other and freely configurable).

# List of fields on which filtering is allowed.
# Entries in this list work in a hierarchical way.
# This means that, for instance, filtering on 'dict.sub_dict.foo' is allowed if allowed_filters contains any of 'dict.sub_dict.foo, 'dict.sub_dict' or 'dict'. Instead filtering on 'dict' is allowed if allowed_filters contains 'dict'.
# Can be set to [] (no filters allowed), or ['*'] (fields allowed on every field).
# Defaults to ['*'].
# Please note: If API scraping or DB DoS attacks are a concern, then globally disabling filters (see ALLOWED_FILTERS above) and then whitelisting valid ones at the local level is the way to go.
